# Unsupervised problem
## Testing out clustering methods
Finding out best number of clusters:
1. Dimension reduction using PCA --> to get better insights
2. Building several KMeans models
3. Representing WCSS within different number of clusters
4. Choosing best number of clusters
5. Visualisation clusters labels
6. Predict label on a random sample
